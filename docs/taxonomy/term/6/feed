 <title>Simple Automated Regression Testing Solutions</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/simple-automated-regression-testing-solutions</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 9:30am-9:55am&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p&gt;Most of us understand the value and importance of automated testing for a website undergoing continuous development. However, many of the popular solutions and implementations are either too complex or time-consuming for novices or small teams to utilize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	This presentation will demonstrate simple regression testing workflows beginners can set up using tools like Ghost Inspector and Wraith.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>D8 Webform and Webform Views Integration</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/d8-webform-and-webform-views-integration</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 10:15am-11:10am&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p&gt;In this session, we&#039;ll talk about how we implemented D8 webform (YAMLform) in one of our sites and the development questions and answers that ensued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		8x webform was previously known as YAMLform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Very active contributor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Views integration is a separate module (webform_views)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Webform nodes available as a submodule (webform_node)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Webform was meant to be geared toward newer developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Webform does not use Field API to store submissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Webform does not use views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we were in the middle of changes being made on both webform and webform views--we ended up creating a custom module that converted submissions to nodes so that we could use vanilla Drupal 8 features to display the submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Commerce 2.x Changes Everything</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/commerce-2x-changes-everything</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:15am-11:40am&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p&gt;While Drupal 8 has reached critical mass and is the standard for new site builds, e-commerce projects were left behind... until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal Commerce is completely re-written to leverage the Drupal 8 API and is in many ways a reference implementation for its most advanced features. In this session, we will explore Drupal Commerce&#039;s leadership position in Drupal 7 and how you can build enterprise-grade e-commerce sites with Commerce 2.x in Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there will be a few code snippets, this session will focus on features and functionality over technical topics. Anyone considering building an e-commerce site using Drupal will come away with an understanding of Drupal Commerce 2.x&#039;s features, status and the state of the contrib ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker Brad Jones is a contributor to Drupal Commerce 2.x as well as contributed modules for marketplace sales, memberships and payments. He is CEO of BigIsland.Fish, a Drupal-powered marketplace application that seeks to revolutionize fresh seafood sales.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Put your Authors in the Drivers Seat</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/put-your-authors-drivers-seat</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:45am-12:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Drupal has always been super flexible in terms of content entry screens. We can add whatever fields we like to any content type. However, platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace set the bar pretty high in terms of the content creation experience. Having a video on the page is no longer good enough; the exact placement is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Join me as I share what we’ve been learning at Aten Design Group about building flexible layouts and content in Drupal 8 for clients like History Colorado and Museum of Contemporary Art Denver. I’ll demo how you can combine modules like Paragraphs, Media Entity, Entity Browser and Inline Entity Form to provide a powerful editing experience. These modules have opened up a world of possibilities, but they have also made us ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How many options should we provide? Background image? Background color? Alignment? Number of columns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What is the right balance of separation of configuration and content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I encourage anyone to attend that has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Longed for better Media handling in Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Heard about Paragraphs module but doesn’t understand what it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Explored flexible content/layouts at the node level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Drupal users of all levels will benefit. Users with some level of familiarity with configuring fields and content types may benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Attendees will leave with a greater awareness of what Drupal’s competition is doing and learn about the possibilities in Drupal 8. A sample site with some of the mentioned modules will also be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Building a Donation Form Management System for Denver Rescue Mission</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/building-donation-form-management-system-denver-rescue-mission</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 1:15pm-2:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 211&lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this session we will discuss how we tackled the problem of building a flexible donation form management system which integrated seamlessly with BlackBaud&#039;s Luminate Online donation API. This session will concentrate mostly on the custom back-end and JavaScript development involved in building the donation form management system for Denver Rescue Mission. We will provide some insight to the statistics and feedback we have received from Denver Rescue Mission and some of the custom functionality extensions we built to meet their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Back-end Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss how we approached the task from a mainly technical point of view, specifically the back-end build using the Entity, Form, Block, and Field APIs, and a custom integration with Luminate Online. The system was built to be self-contained and client agnostic, with custom exposed hooks to define custom functionality, and the only contrib modules we relied upon were Entity, EntityReference, and Replicate in a bid to ensure that the contrib footprint was not a barrier to entry for future clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Theming and JavaScript &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our own custom drag-and-drop form builder using JavaScript and we will discuss the merits of such an approach and why we had to roll our own rather than using anything currently available as a contrib module. As part of the development for this module we also created an option for each form instance to define it&#039;s own set of CSS and JS includes to allow for custom styling and functionality on a per-form basis. We will discuss how we achieved this and how we approached JavaScript inheritance for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drupal 8 Views</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/drupal-8-views</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 10:15am-11:10am&lt;/a&gt;Room 215&lt;p&gt;Views was used on more than 80% of all Drupal 7 sites; now it is part of the Drupal 8 core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join in a father/daughter discussion about Views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Learn how to take full advantage of Views&#039; power to create many amazing pages and blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use filters to display only a relevant subset of your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Instead of building 10 different view displays with different filters, learn how a contextual filter would require only a single display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use relationships to combine data from several entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Using contributed modules, Views can turn your data into maps, carousels, and other unique displays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we&#039;ll start by clarifying termininology.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then we&#039;ll modify a view built into core that everyone uses, the content page to create a custom content editor dashboard.&lt;br /&gt;
	From there, we&#039;ll build our own simple what&#039;s new content list.&lt;br /&gt;
	Next we&#039;ll expand and extend that list to create more complex displays, including maps and carousels.&lt;br /&gt;
	Finally we&#039;ll look at ways to make Views display exactly what you want in the format you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Learn &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Create displays of content that are automatically updated when you add new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Show maps and rotating image carousels on your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use fields from more than one content type to create powerful views of multi-table data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Modify the field data being displayed, combining it in different ways or changing the HTML that might be normally generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Add headers and footers above and below a views display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Make the output of your view look exactly like the designer specifies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Change the order in which a list of content is displayed, limit the content shown to only certain content types or values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Filter content using values passed to the view in the URL, making a single view work different ways&lt;/li&gt;

 <title>OOP, Design Patterns and Drupal 8</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/oop-design-patterns-and-drupal-8</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 3:30pm-4:25pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 211&lt;p&gt;With the switch to OOP and the inclusion of many parts of the Symfony framework, Drupal 8 has (finally) moved into the modern era of web development best practices. Let&#039;s have a look at how some of those best practices are being put to use within Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session I will walk you through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
					Object Oriented Programming concepts, such as interfaces, abstract classes, (base) classes, dependency injection, services and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
					Specific code examples of how Drupal 8 is using the aforementioned OOP concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
					Patterns that are prevalent in Drupal 8 (and that will help you get up to speed much more quickly once you know how to use them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a web developer who has never used Drupal or you are a seasoned Drupal developer who is concerned that all this new OOP stuff is just too hard, you&#039;ll want to attend this session so that you can see just how amazing and easy to use Drupal 8 really is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		Learning Objectives &amp;amp; Outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
					Basic OOP concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
					The fundamental and repeated patterns used in Drupal 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
					Using the OOP concepts and Drupal 8 patterns to create a functioning module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AsKWJDb-bpU&quot;&gt;session recording&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus, we provide in-classroom mentors who will assist you with any questions you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#this-training-is-for-you&quot; id=&quot;this-training-is-for-you&quot;&gt;This training is for you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		If you want to meet lots Drupal experts and get tons of one-on-one help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		If you feel like you learn faster or slower than a typical student and want to set your own pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		If you have a hard time listening to lectures (who doesn&#039;t?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		If you typically have a lot of questions about what you&#039;re learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		If you&#039;re not sure what your skill level is or what you should be focusing on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#why-this-training-is-amaz&quot; id=&quot;why-this-training-is-amaz&quot;&gt;Why this training is amazing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This training has helped hundreds and hundreds of students over the last couple of years, and allows every single student to focus and learn the material that will be the most useful to them. Here&#039;s a breakdown of the big benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of one-on-one help:&lt;/strong&gt; This training is all about personal interactions between you and Drupal experts (More than 10 of them are on board). If you have particular tools you want to learn, or hurdles you&#039;re trying to get over in your current projects, you&#039;ll have a chance to talk one-on-one with trainers who can help. Our team not only has extensive experience in the field, they are also seasoned trainers and can help you with the tools you need to discover your own solutions once you&#039;re out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn at your own pace: &lt;/strong&gt;Whereas most trainings are the same for every student, in this training you get to &lt;em&gt;work at your own pace&lt;/em&gt; through material that&#039;s&lt;em&gt; just right for your skill level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-world scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s relatively easy to learn Drupal in pieces, the hard part is putting the pieces together for practical projects. In this training, you have the opportunity to learn in a way that shows you how each piece works together in real-world projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rocking good time:&lt;/strong&gt; Because you get the opportunity to interact with skilled trainers and other students more than you would in other trainings, it can be a lot more fun and allow you to make connections that will really come in handy later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#what-you-will-be-learning&quot; id=&quot;what-you-will-be-learning&quot;&gt;What you will be learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extensive &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildamodule.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BuildAModule&lt;/a&gt; curriculum allows you to focus on exactly what you need to know. You will only be able to work through a portion of the videos in the classroom, but we give you 8-days of access to the video library so you can start before the training and continue long after the training is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the training, you can focus on one topic, or build up some basics in several topics. We will have experts that are well-versed in all of these and that can help you choose where you start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Basic Site Building:&lt;/strong&gt; If you&#039;re new to Drupal, this will get you familiar with basic concepts, modules and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Site Building:&lt;/strong&gt; How to work with modules like Views, Panels and Display Suite to position and organize content on your site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

	&lt;a href=&quot;#how-it-works&quot; id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the training might sound a little strange if you haven&#039;t experience it before, but it&#039;s incredibly powerful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Step 1: Select a set of videos to focus on&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why videos? By using videos, we allow you to move at your own pace through what is usually a very linear lecture. Instead of sitting back and listing to someone talk on stage, you can instead experience the same lecture in bite-sized pieces that you can play back at half- or double-speed while skipping what you already know, all of which help you to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each video also has a scrolling transcript which allows you to use parts of your brain that aren&#039;t used nearly as much in a typical lecture, helping you to keep focused and comprehend more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Step 2: When you have questions or problems, grab a mentor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we&#039;re not lecturing, us trainers are free to help you 100% of the time with your questions, no matter how basic or complicated. And you won&#039;t be interrupting anyone by getting help, since there&#039;s not a lecture being piped over the loudspeakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But can&#039;t I watch videos at home?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question! And yes, definitely. In fact, we give you full access to our video library and encourage you to watch as many videos as you can before the training so you can come with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some real advantages to watching the videos in a focused training like this, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Experts are &lt;strong&gt;within reach&lt;/strong&gt; all the time to help you with questions or problems (this is huge!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Trainers can &lt;strong&gt;help direct you&lt;/strong&gt; in real time when there&#039;s something specific you want to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		It&#039;s much easier to &lt;strong&gt;stay focused&lt;/strong&gt; when you&#039;re with a group of people all learning at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Video learning is &lt;strong&gt;more enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt; in a group, and that increases stamina and makes it feel less like work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;

	&lt;a href=&quot;#happy-trainee-feedback&quot; id=&quot;happy-trainee-feedback&quot;&gt;Happy trainee feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I&#039;m totally happy. I solved a problem I&#039;ve been working on for months&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The mentored training was new to me and it was a fun experience. You are a gifted teacher.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Excellent set of resources, between access to all the videos and the helpful mentors.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot; Today&#039;s run-through was good for me in several ways. It got me on track to learn what I need to about PHP and some of the other components. Also, I am the sort of person who really likes to hear discussions among people who are more advanced in a subject that I am ...The conversations I was able to listen in on exposed me to facets of the subject I&#039;d never imagined. Thanks to today&#039;s work, I have been able to refocus my efforts and know what I need to do … I appreciate all the effort, do keep up the good work.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;It absolutely rocked! Lots of positive feedback. Some of the trainees were doing some amazing things by the end of the day, having started from scratch.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;We had a great time at the TCDrupal Build a Module training yesterday. We had almost 40 attendees and they were *very* engaged. Everyone came back ready to rock after lunch, and we even picked up a few people from the more advanced training. Everyone was so engrossed that we had to drag them away from their laptops when it was time to go!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Wow! Really enjoying this. You have done such a good job of explaining this stuff. I&#039;m here at the Drupal Camp in Minneapolis, Minnesota today with all the people doing your training and it seems to be going really well. At lunch we had some good discussions about this.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just wanted to follow up to let you know that training on Saturday was a big success. We had about 25 students. We got really positive feedback, and people seemed extremely happy with the day.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
