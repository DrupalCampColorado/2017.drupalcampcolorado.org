 <title>Tools of the Trade</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/tools-trade</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:15am-11:40am&lt;/a&gt;Room 213&lt;p&gt;So you&#039;re a Drupalista delivering professional services that delight and amaze your clients! In an ideal world, you&#039;re spending 90% of your time to achieve that end. Unfortunately, like death and taxes, nobody can avoid the overhead. Everything from billing, support, document management, project management, and secret management can make or break your ability to meet this ideal goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In this panel, we invite 4 members from local agencies to discuss pain points and success stories on adopting and/or building tools to help streamline internal and external processes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Levelling Up: How to Go from Developer to CTO</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/levelling-how-go-developer-cto</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 3:30pm-4:25pm&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p&gt;Being a developer today means that you don’t have a hard time finding a job. But in many developers’ lives comes the day when they realize they want more. Not just a new job, or new technologies, or new projects, but a whole new level. They want to be their own bosses. Maybe even other people’s bosses. They want to make the decisions, run their businesses, and be fully in charge of their destinies. But how can you make the transition successfully? And more importantly, do you really want it? Will it make you happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I made the leap of faith and founded my first company after years of being a developer I didn’t have the answers, and although everything worked out well - Cheppers had nearly 50 employees by the time I stepped down as a CTO - nothing worked out as I expected. I&#039;m going to tell you my story, sharing everything I’ve learnt, all the mistakes, all the difficulties, and all the good, the bad, and the ugly decisions I faced during this period, so you can be more prepared when you decide to Level Up and go from Developer to CTO.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Simple Automated Regression Testing Solutions</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/simple-automated-regression-testing-solutions</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 9:30am-9:55am&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p&gt;Most of us understand the value and importance of automated testing for a website undergoing continuous development. However, many of the popular solutions and implementations are either too complex or time-consuming for novices or small teams to utilize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	This presentation will demonstrate simple regression testing workflows beginners can set up using tools like Ghost Inspector and Wraith.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Put your Authors in the Drivers Seat</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/put-your-authors-drivers-seat</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:45am-12:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Recital Hall&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Drupal has always been super flexible in terms of content entry screens. We can add whatever fields we like to any content type. However, platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace set the bar pretty high in terms of the content creation experience. Having a video on the page is no longer good enough; the exact placement is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Join me as I share what we’ve been learning at Aten Design Group about building flexible layouts and content in Drupal 8 for clients like History Colorado and Museum of Contemporary Art Denver. I’ll demo how you can combine modules like Paragraphs, Media Entity, Entity Browser and Inline Entity Form to provide a powerful editing experience. These modules have opened up a world of possibilities, but they have also made us ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How many options should we provide? Background image? Background color? Alignment? Number of columns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What is the right balance of separation of configuration and content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I encourage anyone to attend that has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Longed for better Media handling in Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Heard about Paragraphs module but doesn’t understand what it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Explored flexible content/layouts at the node level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Drupal users of all levels will benefit. Users with some level of familiarity with configuring fields and content types may benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Attendees will leave with a greater awareness of what Drupal’s competition is doing and learn about the possibilities in Drupal 8. A sample site with some of the mentioned modules will also be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Firewise 2.0: Bringing a paper process online with Drupal 8</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/firewise-20-bringing-paper-process-online-drupal-8</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:15am-12:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 215&lt;p&gt;Firewise USA™ teaches individuals how to adapt to living with wildfires and how to take action as a community in order to prevent loss of property. The program’s paper application process has existed for 15 years, but, in 2016, the Firewise team decided to bring the process online, using Drupal 8 as their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Join Aron Anderson, Associate Project Manager in the Wildland Fire Operations Division of the NFPA, and Nick Switzer, Development Director at Elevated Third, to discuss the challenges and rewards of bringing a paper process online as a Drupal 8 web app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Topics we’ll discuss include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Organizational hurdles to overcome when adding structure and bringing an established paper application process online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Leveraging an agile philosophy to respond quickly to change, collaborate across disciplines and stakeholder groups and get to a working product in as little amount of time as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Balancing effective deliverables with shared understanding to produce working software that meets the organization’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Development workflow leveraging Composer, Git and Configuration Management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides: &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/nickswitzer/dcco17-firewise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://slides.com/nickswitzer/dcco17-firewise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Accessible websites can’t be achieved by just one person. Learn how to get your whole team involved</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/accessible-websites-can%E2%80%99t-be-achieved-just-one-person-learn-how-get-your-whole-team-involved</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 10:15am-11:10am&lt;/a&gt;Room 211&lt;p&gt;The internet is the main source of information for most people in today’s world. We must make sure everyone is able to access and enjoy the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think your site is easy to use and beautifully designed, but have you thought about how a visually impaired person may interact with your site? How about someone with mobility issues or prosthetics? Today, 53 million adults in the United States live with some form of a disability – roughly 22% of the adult population. This doesn’t even include the number of internet and smartphone obsessed children who would qualify as disabled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following basic guidelines for an accessible website, your business or organization will broaden its sphere of influence by accommodating all users, not just those with disabilities. It may seem like a lot of work, time, and money, but we all need to take these first steps to a create a great experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most people think about creating an accessible site or app, they tend to think about the code. In reality, designer, developer and content creator need to collaborate to create an accessible product. With the rise of “design and build your own website” products, it’s beneficial to understand simple techniques that enhance your site both visually and structurally. You’ll learn a handful during this session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where technology is ever changing. Where every day is a new learning experience, and we are expected to adapt and grow. Together, we’ll dive in and discuss who we are making these accommodations for, common difficulties users may face, and the various ways to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>My Journey: Learning Disabled, Fine Artist, Technology Professional in an Open Source World.</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/my-journey-learning-disabled-fine-artist-technology-professional-open-source-world</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 1:15pm-2:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 213&lt;p&gt;My journey to open source technology professional: Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in Studio Art and minoring in Theatre. Master of Fine Arts in Theater and a certification in Non-Profit Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Your degrees are in what?!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and severe learning disabilities as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did that take me to making a career in the world of open source? How did these building blocks in life set me up to successfully metamorphose from fine artist to technology professional at Pfizer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, my parents were told that I was bright, but I would likely never learn to read or write. In retrospect, the very challenge of my learning disability made a positive impact, helped me be open to opportunity, and drove to choose a completely unexpected career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every step of my life, I was in the right place at the right time, grabbing opportunities where they could be found. Whether it was learning to read because I wanted to sing in a choir, or happening to be part of a crazy online project with a Dance company when the World Wide Web was in its nascent form, or pushing the boundaries of what an MFA in arts administration really ought to be, understanding those moments where your life pivots and taking full advantage of them can make the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll openly share my own pitfalls and failings, too--professional, medical, and academic. Any of them could have become a weak link in the chain that brought me to my current role, but I clawed my way out and kept going..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope discussing my experiences can help you recognise your own moments when everything can pivot, in ways that will positively impact your life and career.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unravel Your Brand to Boost Your Business</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/unravel-your-brand-boost-your-business</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 3:30pm-4:25pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 215&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the words &quot;sales and marketing&quot; make you want to throw up in your mouth a little bit? &lt;/strong&gt;Let me guess - &lt;em&gt;you&#039;d rather be up all night fixing bugs in your modules...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or - maybe you don&#039;t technically hate the idea, &lt;em&gt;you just don&#039;t know the best way to approach it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You know Drupal developers are the true magic makers - after all, ideas are merely ideas until you turn them into reality. But how do you&lt;strong&gt; grow your business and land better contracts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#039;s the reality: nobody cares about your story. &lt;/strong&gt;(That may be contrary to say, but what they *do* care about makes your job easier!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Whether you’re a solo developer, or the leader of a full Drupal agency, building a solid brand that will resonate with your desired clients is easier than you think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In this session, &lt;strong&gt;I&#039;ll teach you what creative agencies don&#039;t:&lt;/strong&gt; the most important ingredient to growth. I&#039;ll also give you actionable tips you can apply immediately to start attracting more leads. You&#039;ll leave knowing how to leverage this information to &lt;strong&gt;win prospects, increase your bottom line, and avoid that nasty taste in your mouth.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drutopia and the Rise of Platform Cooperatives</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/drutopia-and-rise-platform-cooperatives</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 11:45am-12:10pm&lt;/a&gt;Room 211&lt;p&gt;Digital platforms such as Facebook, Uber, and AirBNB impact our lives in tremendous ways, organizing people on unprecendented scales. They have both broken down barriers in traditional industries and also been rife with scandal and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform cooperative movement brings the democratic and ethical values of cooperatives into the world of digital platforms. These platforms provide services and coordinate activity like their corporate counterparts, but instead are collectively owned and governed by the people who depend on and participate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll review some of the existing platform coops as well as a new platform coop developing in the Drupal community called Drutopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will leave with an understanding of the platform coop movement and where Drutopia is currently at and where it is going.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drupal 8 Views</title>
 <link>https://dev-2017drupalcampcoloradoorg.pantheonsite.io/session/drupal-8-views</link>
 <description>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/july-29th-camp&quot;&gt;July 29th - CAMP 10:15am-11:10am&lt;/a&gt;Room 215&lt;p&gt;Views was used on more than 80% of all Drupal 7 sites; now it is part of the Drupal 8 core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join in a father/daughter discussion about Views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Learn how to take full advantage of Views&#039; power to create many amazing pages and blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use filters to display only a relevant subset of your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Instead of building 10 different view displays with different filters, learn how a contextual filter would require only a single display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use relationships to combine data from several entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Using contributed modules, Views can turn your data into maps, carousels, and other unique displays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we&#039;ll start by clarifying termininology.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then we&#039;ll modify a view built into core that everyone uses, the content page to create a custom content editor dashboard.&lt;br /&gt;
	From there, we&#039;ll build our own simple what&#039;s new content list.&lt;br /&gt;
	Next we&#039;ll expand and extend that list to create more complex displays, including maps and carousels.&lt;br /&gt;
	Finally we&#039;ll look at ways to make Views display exactly what you want in the format you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Learn &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		Create displays of content that are automatically updated when you add new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Show maps and rotating image carousels on your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Use fields from more than one content type to create powerful views of multi-table data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Modify the field data being displayed, combining it in different ways or changing the HTML that might be normally generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Add headers and footers above and below a views display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Make the output of your view look exactly like the designer specifies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Change the order in which a list of content is displayed, limit the content shown to only certain content types or values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Filter content using values passed to the view in the URL, making a single view work different ways&lt;/li&gt;
